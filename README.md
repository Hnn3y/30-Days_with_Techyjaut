# 30-Days_with_Techyjaut 🚀

Welcome to **30-Days_with_Techyjaut**, a focused learning journey and daily project log for the month of **June 2025**, dedicated to sharpening my skills in **Backend Development** and **CAD Design**. This challenge is inspired by my commitment to build robust software solutions and mechanical systems, and to document my consistent growth in these core domains.

---

## 📅 Challenge Overview

For 30 days, I will:
- **Build, document, and push daily backend projects** using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs.
- **Design and model mechanical parts** using CAD tools like SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, or FreeCAD.
- Share key takeaways, progress, and improvements on a daily basis.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen my **Backend development** skill.
- Develop practical CAD modeling experience.
- Maintain consistency through daily coding and modeling.
- Push toward becoming a **Full-stack developer and CAD expert**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

### Backend
- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Frameworks**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Utilities**: Postman, Git, GitHub

### CAD
- **Primary Software**: SolidWorks / Fusion 360 / AutoCAD (depending on availability)
- **Formats**: `.SLDPRT`, `.STEP`, `.STL`, `.F3D`

## 📌 Notes

- This 30-day challenge is a pivotal phase in my long-term pursuit of becoming a **world-class Software Engineer and Mechanical Systems Designer** — blending code with computation-driven design.
- Each day's work is not just an output, but a **building block toward real-world systems**: from APIs and data services to CAD assemblies for functional prototypes.
- All progress will be tracked with transparency — showcasing **project structure, technical decisions, and learned principles**.
- I welcome constructive feedback, code reviews, and collaboration opportunities. If you're a fellow developer, designer, or engineer, feel free to:
  - Open an issue for discussion or suggestions
  - Submit a pull request to contribute
  - Connect with me for insights or collaborations

> Every commit is a step toward mastering the art of building systems — both digital and mechanical.

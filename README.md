# 30-Days_with_Techyjaunt 🚀

Welcome to 30-Days_with_Techyjaunt — a structured, purpose-driven learning sprint for the month of June 2025. This repository documents my commitment to mastering two high-impact technical domains:
Backend Development and Computer-Aided Design (CAD).

This challenge represents more than daily practice — it's a strategic journey to:

Engineer scalable backend systems using modern development stacks.

Model precise, production-ready mechanical components with industry-standard CAD tools.

Every day of this challenge is intentionally designed to bridge software logic and mechanical design thinking, with the end goal of building solutions that are not only functional but manufacturable — a synergy crucial for full-stack system builders and product engineers.

Whether you're a fellow developer, aspiring engineer, or tech enthusiast, this repository offers a transparent look into daily problem-solving, technical growth, and real-world applications of backend and CAD skills.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

For 30 days, I will:
- **Build, document, and push daily backend projects** using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs.
- **Design and model mechanical parts** using CAD tools like SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, or FreeCAD.
- Share key takeaways, progress, and improvements on a daily basis.

## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen my **Backend development** skill.
- Develop practical CAD modeling experience.
- Maintain consistency through daily coding and modeling.
- Push toward becoming a **Full-stack developer and CAD expert**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

### Backend
- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Frameworks**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Utilities**: Postman, Git, GitHub

### CAD
- **Primary Software**: SolidWorks / Fusion 360 / AutoCAD (depending on availability)
- **Formats**: `.SLDPRT`, `.STEP`, `.STL`, `.F3D`
- GitHub: [@HENNEY`S SOLIDWORKS REPO](https://github.com/Hnn3y/SolidWorks_Repo.git)

## 📌 Notes

- This 30-day challenge is a pivotal phase in my long-term pursuit of becoming a **world-class Software Engineer and Mechanical Systems Designer** — blending code with computation-driven design.
- Each day's work is not just an output, but a **building block toward real-world systems**: from APIs and data services to CAD assemblies for functional prototypes.
- All progress will be tracked with transparency — showcasing **project structure, technical decisions, and learned principles**.
- I welcome constructive feedback, code reviews, and collaboration opportunities. If you're a fellow developer, designer, or engineer, feel free to:
  - Open an issue for discussion or suggestions
  - Submit a pull request to contribute
  - Connect with me for insights or collaborations

> Every commit is a step toward mastering the art of building systems — both digital and mechanical.
